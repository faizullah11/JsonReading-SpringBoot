
Hi 

This is backend application that read json file remotly.

This application reqiure spring 4 framework. 
This is maven build application.
pom.xml have all jars for this application.
Also a web server (I have used appache tomcat 9) is reqiure.
MySql database is used for retrieving.


This is spring-boot backend source code.

This application contain /tours/refresh function that refresh the MySql database.
When the name is ​null​ then all tours will be imported from the remote JSON file.
When the name is a given word then only tours whose name contain the given word will be imported. 

/tours is used to get all tours from Mysql database.
/findToursByName this will return the tour with matching name.


Thanks Faizullah
